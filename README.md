## Tips
If you're trying to use this guide on something like [Google Cloud Shell] (https://shell.cloud.google.com), you may be limited on the ports you can use. For Cloud Shell VMs, you may be limited to 20, 21, 22, 80, 443, 2375, 2376, 3306, 8080, 9600, and 50051 for your open ports. You might also have to try using a VPN to place the Cloud Shell VM near the Minecraft server you want to play on.
